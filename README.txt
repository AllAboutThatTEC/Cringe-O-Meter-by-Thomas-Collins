HI! I'm 12 years old and I love programming and Technology.
I created this program as a thank-you to the first 20 subscribers to my YouTube channel. 
This program is intended to be humorous, it is not intended to offend.
The "cringe level" is completely random, it is just a random integer between 1 and 100. 
This program is open-source, licensed under GNU/GPL.
This program "Cringe-O-Meter" is written by Thomas Collins, in the C# programming language. 
I used Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 RC as my development environment. 
Please Check out, and subscribe to my YouTube channel, it would help me out. ;-)

I would like to dedicate this especially to my dad who inspires me and supports my passion for computer programming,
and helps me the best he can when I get stuck. 
This is also dedicated to the rest of my family who all support my passion as well. 
Finally, I would like to thank my very first subscribers!
